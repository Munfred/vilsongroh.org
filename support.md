# Support the Pode Crer Program
### Technology, civics and leadership education for marginalized youth

- Pode Crer is a new educational program being piloted in Florian√≥polis in Brazil that aims to create an inclusive knowledge economy 
- It provides complementary education focusing on on civics, technology, communication and expression, and socio-emotional skills
with program hubs in each communities - "social innovations centers"
- Pode Crer was created to scale, the pilot is in the second year happening in two locations with 300 youth ages 11-24
- The plan is to create social innovation centers across 5 communities where the Vilson Groh Institute already operates to serve as Pode Crer hubs, and change each community from the inside out 
- Pode Crer is free, and we are fundraising to support continuing operations. One year of Pode Crer for 300 youth costs $240k USD. One social innovation center costs $1.2M
- Pode Crer is impactful. Of 200 youth aged 14+ in 2021, 66 went got jobs and internships after the program (37 in tech) and 7 went to university. These are vulnerable youth from violent and marginalized communities, this kind of impact life changing for these youth, who are prone to fall into violence, drug trafficking and underemployment.
