The Vilson Groh Institute is a Brazilian nonprofit that coordinates the work of a network of six organizations that for over 20 years have been working to uplift marginalized communities, and currently reaches over 5000 people and 2000 families. Their focus is on youth education, social support, social integration, professional preparation and community development in the urban periphery. For over 40 years Vilson Groh has been living in these communities and creating a more peaceful and just future in Brazil.

Vilson Groh moved in 1978  to a marginalized community in Florianópolis, then a favela, and never left. Now 66 years old and going strong, Vilson Groh’s vision and passion have blossomed into a network coordinating almost 400 volunteers working across six nonprofits. The institute’s focus is on providing opportunity to at-risk youth, by supporting families, providing full time and part time educational programs, helping train and equip individuals for their first job, and providing scholarships for technical and university level education.

## The Pode Crer Program 
In March 2021 the Vilson Groh Institute launched a major educational initiative in greater Florianópolis called Pode Crer, where 320 youth are getting one year of technology focused education, and by the end of which they are matched in internships with technology companies - breaking the cycle of poverty, inserting themselves in the job market, and changing their communities. The first year of implementation of the Pode Crer program offers two tracks of classes, for ages 11-13 and for 14+ years of age.

## A Vision for the Future: Social Innovation Centers

The institute’s grand project for the next few years is to shatter social segregation by building innovation centers across five marginalized communities in the Florianópolis region - to serve as a development model for the rest of Brazil. The projects and studies for the first center are done, and the estimated construction cost is 6 million brazilian reais, about 1.1 million US dollars. The project includes a library, maker lab, co-working space, classrooms and socialization spaces. It will be built smack atop a hill in Mont Serrat - the community where Vilson Groh lives at - and completely reinvent the community’s image.

## The history of Vilson Groh

Vilson Groh was born and raised in Brusque, a city founded by German immigrants in 1860 in the state of Santa Catarina. Having recently graduated in theology, he came to Florianópolis in 1978 to study Theology at the Federal University of Santa Catarina - UFSC.

In 1979, he arrived at Morro do Mocotó, where he was welcomed by Claudete, a black woman, and practitioner of Umbanda - an Afro-Brazilian religion that blends African traditions with Roman Catholicism, Spiritism, and Indigenous beliefs. This friendship consolidated a strong perception of what life in the "periphery" really means - in the hills and favelas, without access to opportunity.

In 1983, he moved to Mont Serrat hill, where he has lived since then. His live has been one of total devotion for social justice. “I am a happy person. If I died, I would not be aware of saying what I did or what I did not do. Life has always been a surrender. This surrender internally gives you inner peace, which is not the peace of cemeteries, it is the peace of struggle.”

Through Vilson Groh's leadership and that of many others, small projects have flourished and became reference organizations in communities. The the most prominent ones are:

- ACAM (Mocotó Hill Children Friends Association), which welcomes children and adolescents in need of support at the Mocotó hill
- CEDEP (Popular Education Center), which provides several cultural and educational initiatives
- CCEA (Slave Anastácia Cultural Center) which welcomed children in the school day so as not to leave anyone on the street and maintains a shelter at Monte Serrat for children victims of violence and family problems

As time went on other organizations joined the movement, and the Vilson Groh Institute was founded in 2011, to strengthen the actions of these organizations already under the leadership of Vilson Groh.
